The Existential Quantifier
--------------------------

The existential quantifier, which can be entered as ``\ex`` in VS Code,
is used to represent the phrase "there exists."
The formal expression ``∃ x : ℝ, 2 < x ∧ x < 3`` in Lean says
that there is a real number between 2 and 3.
(We will discuss the conjunction symbol, ``∧``, in :numref:`conjunction_and_biimplication`.)
The canonical way to prove such a statement is to exhibit a real number
and show that it has the stated property.
The number 2.5, which we can enter as ``5 / 2``
or ``(5 : ℝ) / 2`` when Lean cannot infer from context that we have
the real numbers in mind, has the required property,
and the ``norm_num`` tactic can prove that it meets the description.

.. index:: use, tactics ; use

There are a few ways we can put the information together.
Given a goal that begins with an existential quantifier,
the ``use`` tactic is used to provide the object,
leaving the goal of proving the property.

example : ∃ x : ℝ, 2 < x ∧ x < 3 :=

.. index:: anonymous constructor

Alternatively, we can use Lean's *anonymous constructor* notation
to construct the proof.

-- QUOTE:
example : ∃ x : ℝ, 2 < x ∧ x < 3 :=
begin
  have h : 2 < (5 : ℝ) / 2 ∧ (5 : ℝ) / 2 < 3,
    by norm_num,
  exact ⟨5 / 2, h⟩
end
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
The left and right angle brackets,
which can be entered as ``\<`` and ``\>`` respectively,
tell Lean to put together the given data using
whatever construction is appropriate
for the current goal.
We can use the notation without going first into tactic mode:

⟨5 / 2, by norm_num⟩

/- TEXT:
So now we know how to *prove* an exists statement.
But how do we *use* one?
If we know that there exists an object with a certain property,
we should be able to give a name to an arbitrary one
and reason about it.
For example, remember the predicates ``fn_ub f a`` and ``fn_lb f a``
from the last section,
which say that ``a`` is an upper bound or lower bound on ``f``,
respectively.
We can use the existential quantifier to say that "``f`` is bounded"
without specifying the bound:

-- QUOTE:
def fn_ub (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, f x ≤ a
def fn_lb (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, a ≤ f x

def fn_has_ub (f : ℝ → ℝ) := ∃ a, fn_ub f a
def fn_has_lb (f : ℝ → ℝ) := ∃ a, fn_lb f a
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
We can use the theorem ``fn_ub_add`` from the last section
to prove that if ``f`` and ``g`` have upper bounds,
then so does ``λ x, f x + g x``.

end
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
.. index:: cases, tactics ; cases

The ``cases`` tactic unpacks the information
in the existential quantifier.
Given the hypothesis ``ubf`` that there is an upper bound
for ``f``,
``cases`` adds a new variable for an upper
bound to the context,
together with the hypothesis that it has the given property.
The ``with`` clause allows us to specify the names
we want Lean to use.
The goal is left unchanged;
what *has* changed is that we can now use
the new object and the new hypothesis
to prove the goal.
This is a common pattern in mathematics:
we unpack objects whose existence is asserted or implied
by some hypothesis, and then use it to establish the existence
of something else.

Try using this pattern to establish the following.
You might find it useful to turn some of the examples
from the last section into named theorems,
as we did with ``fn_ub_add``,
or you can insert the arguments directly
into the proofs.

.. index:: rintros, tactics ; rintros, rcases, tactics ; rcases

The task of unpacking information in a hypothesis is
so important that Lean and mathlib provide a number of
ways to do it.
A cousin of the ``cases`` tactic, ``rcases``, is more
flexible in that it allows us to unpack nested data.
(The "r" stands for "recursive.")
In the ``with`` clause for unpacking an existential quantifier,
we name the object and the hypothesis by presenting
them as a pattern ``⟨a, h⟩`` that ``rcases`` then tries to match.
The ``rintro`` tactic (which can also be written ``rintros``)
is a combination of ``intros`` and ``rcases``.
These examples illustrate their use:

  rcases ubg with ⟨b, ubfb⟩,

These are power-user moves, and there is no harm
in favoring the use of ``cases`` until you are more comfortable
with the existential quantifier.
But we will come to learn that all of these tools,
including ``cases``, ``use``, and the anonymous constructors,
are like Swiss army knives when it comes to theorem proving.
They can be used for a wide range of purposes,
not just for unpacking exists statements.

To illustrate one way that ``rcases`` can be used,
we prove an old mathematical chestnut:
if two integers ``x`` and ``y`` can each be written as
a sum of two squares,
then so can their product, ``x * y``.
In fact, the statement is true for any commutative
ring, not just the integers.
In the next example, ``rcases`` unpacks two existential
quantifiers at once.
We then provide the magic values needed to express ``x * y``
as a sum of squares as a list to the ``use`` statement,
and we use ``ring`` to verify that they work.

/- TEXT:
This proof doesn't provide much insight,
but here is one way to motivate it.
A *Gaussian integer* is a number of the form :math:`a + bi`
where :math:`a` and :math:`b` are integers and :math:`i = \sqrt{-1}`.
The *norm* of the Gaussian integer :math:`a + bi` is, by definition,
:math:`a^2 + b^2`.
So the norm of a Gaussian integer is a sum of squares,
and any sum of squares can be expressed in this way.
The theorem above reflects the fact that norm of a product of
Gaussian integers is the product of their norms:
if :math:`x` is the norm of :math:`a + bi` and
:math:`y` in the norm of :math:`c + di`,
then :math:`xy` is the norm of :math:`(a + bi) (c + di)`.
Our cryptic proof illustrates the fact that
the proof that is easiest to formalize isn't always
the most perspicuous one.
In the chapters to come,
we will provide you with the means to define the Gaussian
integers and use them to provide an alternative proof.

The pattern of unpacking an equation inside an existential quantifier
and then using it to rewrite an expression in the goal
comes up often,
so much so that the ``rcases`` tactic provides
an abbreviation:
if you use the keyword ``rfl`` in place of a new identifier,
``rcases`` does the rewriting automatically (this trick doesn't work
with pattern-matching lambdas).

.. index:: surjective function

For another important example, a function :math:`f : \alpha \to \beta`
is said to be *surjective* if for every :math:`y` in the
codomain, :math:`\beta`,
there is an :math:`x` in the domain, :math:`\alpha`,
such that :math:`f(x) = y`.
Notice that this statement includes both a universal
and an existential quantifier, which explains
why the next example makes use of both ``intro`` and ``use``.
