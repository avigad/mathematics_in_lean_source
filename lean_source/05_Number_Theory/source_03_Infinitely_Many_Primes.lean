Infinitely Many Primes
----------------------

Let us continue our exploration of induction and recursion with another
mathematical standard: a proof that there are infinitely many primes.
One way to formulate this is as the statement that
for every natural number
:math:`n`, there is a prime number greater than :math:`n`.
To prove this, let :math:`p` be any prime factor of :math:`n! + 1`.
If :math:`p` is less than :math:`n`, it divides :math:`n!`.
Since it also divides :math:`n! + 1`, it divides 1, a contradiction.
Hence :math:`p` is greater than :math:`n`.

To formalize that proof, we need to show that any number greater than or equal
to 2 has a prime factor.
To do that, we will need to show that any natural number that is
not equal to 0 or 1 is greater-than or equal to 2.
And this brings us to a quirky feature of formalization:
it is often trivial statements like this that are among the most
annoying to formalize.
Here we consider a few ways to do it.

To start with, we can use the ``cases`` tactic and the fact that the
successor function respects the ordering on the natural numbers.

Another strategy is to use the tactic ``interval_cases``,
which automatically splits the goal into cases when
the variable in question is contained in an interval
of natural numbers or integers.
Remember that you can hover over it to see its documentation.

  interval_cases m; contradiction
end
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
Recall that the semicolon after ``interval_cases m`` means
that the next tactic is applied to each of the cases that it generates.
Yet another option is to use the tactic, ``dec_trivial``, which tries
to find a decision procedure to solve the problem.
Lean knows that you can decide the truth value of a statement that
begins with a bounded quantifier ``∀ x, x < n → ...`` or ``∃ x, x < n ∧ ...``
by deciding each of the finitely many instances.

Finally, in this case we can use the ``omega`` tactic, which is designed
to reason about linear expressions in the natural numbers.

/- TEXT:
With the theorem ``two_le`` in hand, let's start by showing that every
natural number greater than two has a prime divisor.
Mathlib contains a function ``nat.min_fac`` that
returns the smallest prime divisor,
but for the sake of learning new parts of the library,
we'll avoid using it and prove the theorem directly.

Here, ordinary induction isn't enough.
We want to use *strong induction*, which allows us to prove
that every natural number :math:`n` has a property :math:`P`
by showing that for every number :math:`n`, if :math:`P` holds
of all values less than :math:`n`, it holds at :math:`n` as well.
In Lean, this principle is called ``nat.strong_induction_on``,
and we can use the ``with`` keyword to tell the induction tactic
to use it.
Notice that when we do that, there is no base case; it is subsumed
by the general induction step.

The argument is simply as follows. Assuming :math:`n ≥ 2`,
if :math:`n` is prime, we're done. If it isn't,
then by one of the characterizations of what it means to be a prime number,
it has a nontrivial factor, :math:`m`,
and we can apply the inductive hypothesis to that.
Step through the next proof to see how that plays out.
The line ``dsimp at ih`` simplifies the expression of the
inductive hypothesis to make it more readable.
The proof still works if you delete that line.

/- TEXT:
Let's consider a variation of the proof above, where instead
of using the factorial function,
we suppose that we are given by a finite set
:math:`\{ p_1, \ldots, p_n \}` and we consider a prime factor of
:math:`\prod_{i = 1}^n p_i + 1`.
That prime factor has to be distinct from each
:math:`p_i`, showing that there is no finite set that contains
all the prime numbers.

Formalizing this argument requires us to reason about finite
sets. In Lean, for any type ``α``, the type ``finset α``
represents finite sets of elements of type ``α``.
Reasoning about finite sets computationally requires having
a procedure to test equality on ``α``, which is why the snippet
below includes the assumption ``[decidable_eq α]``.
For concrete data types like ``ℕ``, ``ℤ``, and ``ℚ``,
the assumption is satisfied automatically. When reasoning about
the real numbers, it can be satisfied using classical logic
and abandoning the computational interpretation.

We use the command ``open finset`` to avail ourselves of shorter names
for the relevant theorems. Unlike the case with sets,
most equivalences involving finsets do not hold definitionally,
so they need to be expanded manually using equivalances like
``finset.subset_iff``, ``finset.mem_union``, ``finset.mem_inter``,
and ``finset.mem_sdiff``. The ``ext`` tactic can still be used
to reduce show that two finite sets are equal by showing
that every element of one is an element of the other.

We can use this lemma to show that if a prime ``p`` divides a product of a finite
set of primes, then it divides one of them.
Mathlib provides a useful principle of induction on finite sets:
to show that a property holds of an arbitrary finite set ``s``,
show that it holds of the empty set, and show that it is preserved
when we add a single new element ``a ∉ s``.
The principle is known as ``finset.induction_on``.
When we tell the induction tactic to use it, we can also specify the names
``a`` and ``s``, the name for the assumption ``a ∉ s`` in the inductive step,
and the name of the inductive hypothesis.
The expression ``finset.insert a s`` denotes the union of ``s`` with the singleton ``a``.
The identities ``finset.prod_empty`` and ``finset.prod_insert`` then provide
the relevant rewrite rules for the product.
In the proof below, the first ``simp`` applies ``finset.prod_empty``.

We have thus seen two ways of saying that there are infinitely many primes:
saying that they are not bounded by any ``n``, and saying that they are
not contained in any finite set ``s``.
The two proofs below show that these formulations are equivalent.
In the second, in order to form ``s.filter Q``, we have to assume that there
is a procedure for deciding whether or not ``Q`` holds. Lean knows that there
is a procedure for ``nat.prime``. In general, if we use classical logic
by writing ``open_locale classical``,
we can dispense with the assumption.

In mathlib, ``finset.sup s f`` denotes the supremum of the values of ``f x`` as ``x``
ranges over ``s``, returning ``0`` in the case where ``s`` is empty and

A small variation on our second proof that there are infinitely many primes
shows that there are infinitely many primes congruent to 3 modulo 4.
The argument goes as follows.
First, notice that if the product of two numbers :math:`m` and :math:`n`
is equal to 3 modulo 4, then one of the two numbers is congruent to three modulo 4.
After all, both have to be odd, and if they are both congruent to 1 modulo 4,
so is their product.
We can use this observation to show that if some number
greater than 2 is congruent to 3 modulo 4,
then that number has a prime divisor that is also congruent to 3 modulo 4.

Now suppose there are only finitely many prime numbers congruent to 3
modulo 4, say, :math:`p_1, \ldots, p_k`.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that :math:`p_1 = 3`.
Consider the product :math:`4 \prod_{i = 2}^k p_i + 3`.
It is easy to see that this is congruent to 3 modulo 4, so it has
a prime factor :math:`p` congruent to 3 modulo 4.
It can't be the case that :math:`p = 3`; since :math:`p`
divides :math:`4 \prod_{i = 2}^k p_i + 3`, if :math:`p`
were equal to 3 then it would also divide :math:`\prod_{i = 2}^k p_i`,
which implies that :math:`p` is equal to
one of the :math:`p_i` for :math:`i = 2, \ldots, k`;
and we have excluded 3 from this list.
So :math:`p` has to be one of the other elements :math:`p_i`.
But in that case, :math:`p` divides :math:`4 \prod_{i = 2}^k p_i`
and hence 3, which contradicts the fact that it is not 3.

In Lean, the notation ``n % m``, read "``n`` modulo ``m``,"
denotes the remainder of the division of ``n`` by ``m``.
