Sequences and Convergence
-------------------------

We now have enough skills at our disposal to do some real mathematics.
In Lean, we can represent a sequence :math:`s_0, s_1, s_2, \ldots` of
real numbers as a function ``s : ℕ → ℝ``.
Such a sequence is said to *converge* to a number :math:`a` if for every
:math:`\varepsilon > 0` there is a point beyond which the sequence
remains within :math:`\varepsilon` of :math:`a`,
that is, there is a number :math:`N` such that for every
:math:`n \ge N`, :math:`| s_n - a | < \varepsilon`.
In Lean, we can render this as follows:
BOTH: -/
-- QUOTE:
def ConvergesTo (s : ℕ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) :=
  ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, |s n - a| < ε
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
The notation ``∀ ε > 0, ...`` is a convenient abbreviation
for ``∀ ε, ε > 0 → ...``, and, similarly,
``∀ n ≥ N, ...`` abbreviates ``∀ n, n ≥ N →  ...``.
And remember that ``ε > 0``, in turn, is defined as ``0 < ε``,
and ``n ≥ N`` is defined as ``N ≤ n``.

.. index:: extensionality, ext, tactics ; ext

In this section, we'll establish some properties of convergence.
But first, we will discuss three tactics for working with equality
that will prove useful.
The first, the ``ext`` tactic,
gives us a way of proving that two functions are equal.
Let :math:`f(x) = x + 1` and :math:`g(x) = 1 + x`
be functions from reals to reals.
Then, of course, :math:`f = g`, because they return the same
value for every :math:`x`.
The ``ext`` tactic enables us to prove an equation between functions
by proving that their values are the same
at all the values of their arguments.

  ext
  ring
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
.. index:: congr, tactics ; congr

We'll see later that ``ext`` is actually more general, and also one can
specify the name of the variables that appear.
For instance you can try to replace ``ext`` with ``ext u v`` in the
above proof.
The second tactic, the ``congr`` tactic,
allows us to prove an equation between two expressions
by reconciling the parts that are different:

example (a b : ℝ) : |a| = |a - b + b| := by
  congr
  ring
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
Here the ``congr`` tactic peels off the ``abs`` on each side,
leaving us to prove ``a = a - b + b``.

.. index:: convert, tactics ; convert

Finally, the ``convert`` tactic is used to apply a theorem
to a goal when the conclusion of the theorem doesn't quite match.
For example, suppose we want to prove ``a < a * a`` from ``1 < a``.
A theorem in the library, ``mul_lt_mul_right``,
will let us prove ``1 * a < a * a``.
One possibility is to work backwards and rewrite the goal
so that it has that form.
Instead, the ``convert`` tactic lets us apply the theorem
as it is,
and leaves us with the task of proving the equations that
are needed to make the goal match.

example {a : ℝ} (h : 1 < a) : a < a * a := by
  convert (mul_lt_mul_right _).2 h
  · rw [one_mul]
  exact lt_trans zero_lt_one h
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
This example illustrates another useful trick: when we apply an
expression with an underscore
and Lean can't fill it in for us automatically,
it simply leaves it for us as another goal.

The following shows that any constant sequence :math:`a, a, a, \ldots`
converges.

.. TODO: reference to the simplifier

Lean has a tactic, ``simp``, which can often save you the
trouble of carrying out steps like ``rw [sub_self, abs_zero]``
by hand.
We will tell you more about it soon.

For a more interesting theorem, let's show that if ``s``
converges to ``a`` and ``t`` converges to ``b``, then
``fun n ↦ s n + t n`` converges to ``a + b``.
It is helpful to have a clear pen-and-paper
proof in mind before you start writing a formal one.
Given ``ε`` greater than ``0``,
the idea is to use the hypotheses to obtain an ``Ns``
such that beyond that point, ``s`` is within ``ε / 2``
of ``a``,
and an ``Nt`` such that beyond that point, ``t`` is within
``ε / 2`` of ``b``.
Then, whenever ``n`` is greater than or equal to the
maximum of ``Ns`` and ``Nt``,
the sequence ``fun n ↦ s n + t n`` should be within ``ε``
of ``a + b``.
The following example begins to implement this strategy.
See if you can finish it off.

/- TEXT:
As hints, you can use ``le_of_max_le_left`` and ``le_of_max_le_right``,
and ``norm_num`` can prove ``ε / 2 + ε / 2 = ε``.
Also, it is helpful to use the ``congr`` tactic to
show that ``|s n + t n - (a + b)|`` is equal to
``|(s n - a) + (t n - b)|,``
since then you can use the triangle inequality.
Notice that we marked all the variables ``s``, ``t``, ``a``, and ``b``
implicit because they can be inferred from the hypotheses.

Proving the same theorem with multiplication in place
of addition is tricky.
We will get there by proving some auxiliary statements first.
See if you can also finish off the next proof,
which shows that if ``s`` converges to ``a``,
then ``fun n ↦ c * s n`` converges to ``c * a``.
It is helpful to split into cases depending on whether ``c``
is equal to zero or not.
We have taken care of the zero case,
and we have left you to prove the result with
the extra assumption that ``c`` is nonzero.

In fact, the theorem could be strengthened to assert
that there is a bound ``b`` that holds for all values of ``n``.
But this version is strong enough for our purposes,
and we will see at the end of this section that it
holds more generally.

The next lemma is auxiliary: we prove that if
``s`` converges to ``a`` and ``t`` converges to ``0``,
then ``fun n ↦ s n * t n`` converges to ``0``.
To do so, we use the previous theorem to find a ``B``
that bounds ``s`` beyond some point ``N₀``.
See if you can understand the strategy we have outlined
and finish the proof.
