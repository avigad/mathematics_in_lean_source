Conjunction and Iff
-------------------

.. index:: constructor, tactics ; constructor

You have already seen that the conjunction symbol, ``∧``,
is used to express "and."
The ``constructor`` tactic allows you to prove a statement of
the form ``A ∧ B``
by proving ``A`` and then proving ``B``.

/- TEXT:
.. index:: assumption, tactics ; assumption

In this example, the ``assumption`` tactic
tells Lean to find an assumption that will solve the goal.
Notice that the final ``rw`` finishes the goal by
applying the reflexivity of ``≤``.
The following are alternative ways of carrying out
the previous examples using the anonymous constructor
angle brackets.
The first is a slick proof-term version of the
previous proof,
which drops into tactic mode at the keyword ``by``.

/- TEXT:
*Using* a conjunction instead of proving one involves unpacking the proofs of the
two parts.
You can use the ``rcases`` tactic for that,
as well as ``rintro`` or a pattern-matching ``fun``,
all in a manner similar to the way they are used with
the existential quantifier.

In analogy to the ``obtain`` tactic, there is also a pattern-matching ``have``:

In contrast to ``rcases``, here the ``have`` tactic leaves ``h`` in the context.
And even though we won't use them, once again we have the computer scientists'
pattern-matching syntax:

In contrast to using an existential quantifier,
you can also extract proofs of the two components
of a hypothesis ``h : A ∧ B``
by writing ``h.left`` and ``h.right``,
or, equivalently, ``h.1`` and ``h.2``.

/- TEXT:
In the first example, the semicolon after the ``constructor`` command tells Lean to use the
``norm_num`` tactic on both of the goals that result.

In Lean, ``A ↔ B`` is *not* defined to be ``(A → B) ∧ (B → A)``,
but it could have been,
and it behaves roughly the same way.
You have already seen that you can write ``h.mp`` and ``h.mpr``
or ``h.1`` and ``h.2`` for the two directions of ``h : A ↔ B``.
You can also use ``cases`` and friends.
To prove an if-and-only-if statement,
you can use ``constructor`` or angle brackets,
just as you would if you were proving a conjunction.

/- TEXT:
In Lean, bi-implication leads a double-life.
You can treat it like a conjunction and use its two
parts separately.
But Lean also knows that it is a reflexive, symmetric,
and transitive relation between propositions,
and you can also use it with ``calc`` and ``rw``.
It is often convenient to rewrite a statement to
an equivalent one.
In the next example, we use ``abs_lt`` to
replace an expression of the form ``|x| < y``
by the equivalent expression ``- y < x ∧ x < y``,
and in the one after that we use ``Nat.dvd_gcd_iff``
to replace an expression of the form ``m ∣ Nat.gcd n k`` by the equivalent expression ``m ∣ n ∧ m ∣ k``.

The remaining exercises in this section are designed
to give you some more practice with conjunction and
bi-implication. Remember that a *partial order* is a
binary relation that is transitive, reflexive, and
antisymmetric.
An even weaker notion sometimes arises:
a *preorder* is just a reflexive, transitive relation.
For any pre-order ``≤``,
Lean axiomatizes the associated strict pre-order by
``a < b ↔ a ≤ b ∧ ¬ b ≤ a``.
Show that if ``≤`` is a partial order,
then ``a < b`` is equivalent to ``a ≤ b ∧ a ≠ b``:

Beyond logical operations, you do not need
anything more than ``le_refl`` and ``le_trans``.
Show that even in the case where ``≤``
is only assumed to be a preorder,
we can prove that the strict order is irreflexive
and transitive.
In the second example,
for convenience, we use the simplifier rather than ``rw``
to express ``<`` in terms of ``≤`` and ``¬``.
We will come back to the simplifier later,
but here we are only relying on the fact that it will
use the indicated lemma repeatedly, even if it needs
to be instantiated to different values.
