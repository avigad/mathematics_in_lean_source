Proving Identities in Algebraic Structures
------------------------------------------

.. index:: ring (algebraic structure)

Mathematically, a ring consists of a collection of objects,
:math:`R`, operations :math:`+` :math:`\times`, and constants :math:`0`
and :math:`1`, and an operation :math:`x \mapsto -x` such that:

* :math:`R` with :math:`+` is an *abelian group*, with :math:`0`
  as the additive identity and negation as inverse.
* Multiplication is associative with identity :math:`1`,
  and multiplication distributes over addition.

In Lean, the collection of objects is represented as a *type*, ``R``.
The ring axioms are as follows:

You will learn more about the square brackets in the first line later,
but for the time being,
suffice it to say that the declaration gives us a type, ``R``,
and a ring structure on ``R``.
Lean then allows us to use generic ring notation with elements of ``R``,
and to make use of a library of theorems about rings.

The names of some of the theorems should look familiar:
they are exactly the ones we used to calculate with the real numbers
in the last section.
Lean is good not only for proving things about concrete mathematical
structures like the natural numbers and the integers,
but also for proving things about abstract structures,
characterized axiomatically, like rings.
Moreover, Lean supports *generic reasoning* about
both abstract and concrete structures,
and can be trained to recognized appropriate instances.
So any theorem about rings can be applied to concrete rings
like the integers, ``ℤ``, the rational numbers,  ``ℚ``,
and the complex numbers ``ℂ``.
It can also be applied to any instance of an abstract
structure that extends rings,
such as any ordered ring or any field.

.. index:: commutative ring

Not all important properties of the real numbers hold in an
arbitrary ring, however.
For example, multiplication on the real numbers
is commutative,
but that does not hold in general.
If you have taken a course in linear algebra,
you will recognize that, for every :math:`n`,
the :math:`n` by :math:`n` matrices of real numbers
form a ring in which commutativity usually fails. If we declare ``R`` to be a
*commutative* ring, in fact, all the theorems
in the last section continue to hold when we replace
``ℝ`` by ``R``.

We leave it to you to check that all the other proofs go through unchanged.
Notice that when a proof is short, like ``by ring`` or ``by linarith``
or ``by sorry``,
it is common (and permissible) to put it on the same line as
the ``by``.
Good proof-writing style should strike a balance between concision and readability.

The goal of this section is to strengthen the skills
you have developed in the last section
and apply them to reasoning axiomatically about rings.
We will start with the axioms listed above,
and use them to derive other facts.
Most of the facts we prove are already in Mathlib.
We will give the versions we prove the same names
to help you learn the contents of the library
as well as the naming conventions.

.. index:: namespace, open, command ; open

Lean provides an organizational mechanism similar
to those used in programming languages:
when a definition or theorem ``foo`` is introduced in a *namespace*
``bar``, its full name is ``bar.foo``.
The command ``open bar`` later *opens* the namespace,
which allows us to use the shorter name ``foo``.
To avoid errors due to name clashes,
in the next example we put our versions of the library
theorems in a new namespace called ``MyRing.``

The next example shows that we do not need ``add_zero`` or ``add_right_neg``
as ring axioms, because they follow from the other axioms.

namespace MyRing

theorem add_right_neg (a : R) : a + -a = 0 := by rw [add_comm, add_left_neg]

#check MyRing.add_zero
#check add_zero

end MyRing

/- TEXT:
The net effect is that we can temporarily reprove a theorem in the library,
and then go on using the library version after that.
But don't cheat!
In the exercises that follow, take care to use only the
general facts about rings that we have proved earlier in this section.

(If you are paying careful attention, you may have noticed that we
changed the round brackets in ``(R : Type*)`` for
curly brackets in ``{R : Type*}``.
This declares ``R`` to be an *implicit argument*.
We will explain what this means in a moment,
but don't worry about it in the meanwhile.)

Here is a useful theorem:

/- TEXT:
With enough planning, you can do each of them with three rewrites.

.. index:: implicit argument

We will now explain the use of the curly braces.
Imagine you are in a situation where you have ``a``, ``b``, and ``c``
in your context,
as well as a hypothesis ``h : a + b = a + c``,
and you would like to draw the conclusion ``b = c``.
In Lean, you can apply a theorem to hypotheses and facts just
the same way that you can apply them to objects,
so you might think that ``add_left_cancel a b c h`` is a
proof of the fact ``b = c``.
But notice that explicitly writing ``a``, ``b``, and ``c``
is redundant, because the hypothesis ``h`` makes it clear that
those are the objects we have in mind.
In this case, typing a few extra characters is not onerous,
but if we wanted to apply ``add_left_cancel`` to more complicated expressions,
writing them would be tedious.
In cases like these,
Lean allows us to mark arguments as *implicit*,
meaning that they are supposed to be left out and inferred by other means,
such as later arguments and hypotheses.
The curly brackets in ``{a b c : R}`` do exactly that.
So, given the statement of the theorem above,
the correct expression is simply ``add_left_cancel h``.

To illustrate, let us show that ``a * 0 = 0``
follows from the ring axioms.

-- QUOTE:
theorem mul_zero (a : R) : a * 0 = 0 := by
  have h : a * 0 + a * 0 = a * 0 + 0 := by
    rw [← mul_add, add_zero, add_zero]
  rw [add_left_cancel h]
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
.. index:: have, tactics ; have

We have used a new trick!
If you step through the proof,
you can see what is going on.
The ``have`` tactic introduces a new goal,
``a * 0 + a * 0 = a * 0 + 0``,
with the same context as the original goal.
The fact that the next line is indented indicates that Lean
is expecting a block of tactics that serves to prove this
new goal.
The indentation therefore promotes a modular style of proof:
the indented subproof establishes the goal
that was introduced by the ``have``.
After that, we are back to proving the original goal,
except a new hypothesis ``h`` has been added:
having proved it, we are now free to use it.
At this point, the goal is exactly the result of ``add_left_cancel h``.

.. index:: apply, tactics ; apply, exact, tactics ; exact

We could equally well have closed the proof with
``apply add_left_cancel h`` or ``exact add_left_cancel h``.
The ``exact`` tactic takes as argument a proof term which completely proves the
current goal, without creating any new goal. The ``apply`` tactic is a variant
whose argument is not necessarily a complete proof. The missing pieces are either
inferred automatically by Lean or become new goals to prove.
While the ``exact`` tactic is technically redundant since it is strictly less powerful
than ``apply``, it makes proof scripts slightly clearer to
human readers and easier to maintain when the library evolves.

Remember that multiplication is not assumed to be commutative,
so the following theorem also requires some work.

/- TEXT:
We had to use the annotation ``(-0 : R)`` instead of ``0`` in the third theorem
because without specifying ``R``
it is impossible for Lean to infer which ``0`` we have in mind,
and by default it would be interpreted as a natural number.

In Lean, subtraction in a ring is provably equal to
addition of the additive inverse.

.. index:: rfl, reflexivity, tactics ; refl and reflexivity, definitional equality

The proof term ``rfl`` is short for "reflexivity".
Presenting it as a proof of ``a - b = a + -b`` forces Lean
to unfold the definition and recognize both sides as being the same.
The ``rfl`` tactic does the same.
This is an instance of what is known as a *definitional equality*
in Lean's underlying logic.
This means that not only can one rewrite with ``sub_eq_add_neg``
to replace ``a - b = a + -b``,
but in some contexts, when dealing with the real numbers,
you can use the two sides of the equation interchangeably.
For example, you now have enough information to prove the theorem
``self_sub`` from the last section:

you can use that to prove the theorem ``two_mul`` from

.. index:: group (algebraic structure)

We close this section by noting that some of the facts about
addition and negation that we established above do not
need the full strength of the ring axioms, or even
commutativity of addition. The weaker notion of a *group*
can be axiomatized as follows:

It is conventional to use additive notation when
the group operation is commutative,
and multiplicative notation otherwise.
So Lean defines a multiplicative version as well as the

.. index:: group (tactic), tactics ; group, tactics ; noncomm_ring, tactics ; abel

Explicitly invoking those lemmas is tedious, so Mathlib provides
tactics similar to `ring` in order to cover most uses: `group`
is for non-commutative multiplicative groups, `abel` for abelian
additive groups, and `noncomm_ring` for non-commutative rings.
It may seem odd that the algebraic structures are called
`Ring` and `CommRing` while the tactics are named
`noncomm_ring` and `ring`. This is partly for historical reasons,
but also for the convenience of using a shorter name for the
tactic that deals with commutative rings, since it is used more often.
