.. index:: min, max

The ``min`` function on the real numbers is uniquely characterized
by the following three facts:
TEXT. -/
-- BOTH:
section
variable (a b c d : ℝ)

-- QUOTE:
#check (min_le_left a b : min a b ≤ a)
#check (min_le_right a b : min a b ≤ b)
#check (le_min : c ≤ a → c ≤ b → c ≤ min a b)
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
Can you guess the names of the theorems that characterize
``max`` in a similar way?

Notice that we have to apply ``min`` to a pair of arguments ``a`` and ``b``
by writing ``min a b`` rather than ``min (a, b)``.
Formally, ``min`` is a function of type ``ℝ → ℝ → ℝ``.
When we write a type like this with multiple arrows,
the convention is that the implicit parentheses associate
to the right, so the type is interpreted as ``ℝ → (ℝ → ℝ)``.
The net effect is that if ``a`` and ``b`` have type ``ℝ``
then ``min a`` has type ``ℝ → ℝ`` and
``min a b`` has type ``ℝ``, so ``min`` acts like a function
of two arguments, as we expect. Handling multiple
arguments in this way is known as *currying*,
after the logician Haskell Curry.

The order of operations in Lean can also take some getting used to.
Function application binds tighter than infix operations, so the
expression ``min a b + c`` is interpreted as ``(min a b) + c``.
With time, these conventions will become second nature.

Using the theorem ``le_antisymm``, we can show that two
real numbers are equal if each is less than or equal to the other.
Using this and the facts above,
we can show that ``min`` is commutative:
TEXT. -/
-- QUOTE:
example : min a b = min b a := by
  apply le_antisymm
  · show min a b ≤ min b a
    apply le_min
    · apply min_le_right
    apply min_le_left
  · show min b a ≤ min a b
    apply le_min
    · apply min_le_right
    apply min_le_left
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
.. index:: show, tactics ; show

Here we have used dots to separate proofs of
different goals.
Our usage is inconsistent:
at the outer level,
we use dots and indentation for both goals,
whereas for the nested proofs,
we use dots only until a single goal remains.
Both conventions are reasonable and useful.
We also use the ``show`` tactic to structure
the proof
and indicate what is being proved in each block.
The proof still works without the ``show`` commands,
but using them makes the proof easier to read and maintain.

It may bother you that the proof is repetitive.
To foreshadow skills you will learn later on,
we note that one way to avoid the repetition
is to state a local lemma and then use it:
TEXT. -/
-- QUOTE:
example : min a b = min b a := by
  have h : ∀ x y : ℝ, min x y ≤ min y x := by
    intro x y
    apply le_min
    apply min_le_right
    apply min_le_left
  apply le_antisymm
  apply h
  apply h
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
We will say more about the universal quantifier in
:numref:`implication_and_the_universal_quantifier`,
but suffice it to say here that the hypothesis
``h`` says that the desired inequality holds for
any ``x`` and ``y``,
and the ``intro`` tactic introduces an arbitrary
``x`` and ``y`` to establish the conclusion.
The first ``apply`` after ``le_antisymm`` implicitly
uses ``h a b``, whereas the second one uses ``h b a``.

.. index:: repeat, tactics ; repeat

Another solution is to use the ``repeat`` tactic,
which applies a tactic (or a block) as many times
as it can.

/- TEXT:
Of course, you are welcome to prove the associativity of ``max`` as well.

It is an interesting fact that ``min`` distributes over ``max``
the way that multiplication distributes over addition,
and vice-versa.
In other words, on the real numbers, we have the identity
``min a (max b c) ≤ max (min a b) (min a c)``
as well as the corresponding version with ``max`` and ``min``
switched.
But in the next section we will see that this does *not* follow
from the transitivity and reflexivity of ``≤`` and
the characterizing properties of ``min`` and ``max`` enumerated above.
We need to use the fact that ``≤`` on the real numbers is a *total order*,
which is to say,
it satisfies ``∀ x y, x ≤ y ∨ y ≤ x``.
Here the disjunction symbol, ``∨``, represents "or".
In the first case, we have ``min x y = x``,
and in the second case, we have ``min x y = y``.
We will learn how to reason by cases in :numref:`disjunction`,
but for now we will stick to examples that don't require the case split.

Here is one such example:

/- TEXT:
It is clear that ``aux`` provides one of the two inequalities
needed to prove the equality,
but applying it to suitable values yields the other direction
as well.
As a hint, you can use the theorem ``add_neg_cancel_right``
and the ``linarith`` tactic.

See if you can do this in three lines or less.
You can use the theorem ``sub_add_cancel``.

.. index:: divisibility

Another important relation that we will make use of
in the sections to come is the divisibility relation
on the natural numbers, ``x ∣ y``.
Be careful: the divisibility symbol is *not* the
ordinary bar on your keyboard.
Rather, it is a unicode character obtained by
typing ``\|`` in VS Code.
By convention, Mathlib uses ``dvd``
to refer to it in theorem names.

.. index:: gcd, lcm

With respect to divisibility, the *greatest common divisor*,
``gcd``, and least common multiple, ``lcm``,
are analogous to ``min`` and ``max``.
Since every number divides ``0``,
``0`` is really the greatest element with respect to divisibility:

complain that the expression is ambiguous between the generic
theorem and the version ``Nat.dvd_antisymm``,

either one will work.
