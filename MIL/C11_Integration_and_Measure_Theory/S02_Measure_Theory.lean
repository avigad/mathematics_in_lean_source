Measure Theory
--------------

The general context for integration in Mathlib is measure theory. Even the elementary
integrals of the previous section are in fact Bochner integrals. Bochner integration is
a generalization of Lebesgue integration where the target space can be any Banach space,
not necessarily finite dimensional.

The first component in the development of measure theory
is the notion of a :math:`\sigma`-algebra of sets, which are called the
*measurable* sets.
The type class ``MeasurableSpace`` serves to equip a type with such a structure.
The sets ``empty`` and ``univ`` are measurable,
the complement of a measurable set is measurable,
and a countable union or intersection of measurable sets is measurable.
Note that these axioms are redundant; if you ``#print MeasurableSpace``,
you will see the ones that Mathlib uses.
As the examples below show, countability assumptions can be expressed using the
``Encodable`` type class.

  MeasurableSet.iUnion h

example {f : ι → Set α} (h : ∀ b, MeasurableSet (f b)) : MeasurableSet (⋂ b, f b) :=
  MeasurableSet.iInter h

/- TEXT:
Once a type is measurable, we can measure it. On paper, a measure on a set
(or type) equipped with a
:math:`\sigma`-algebra is a function from the measurable sets to
the extended non-negative reals that is
additive on countable disjoint unions.
In Mathlib, we don't want to carry around measurability assumptions
every time we write an application of the measure to a set.
So we extend the measure to any set ``s``
as the infimum of measures of measurable sets containing ``s``.
Of course, many lemmas still require
measurability assumptions, but not all.

/- TEXT:
Once a type has a measure associated with it, we say that a property ``P``
holds *almost everywhere* if the set of elements where the property fails
has measure 0.
The collection of properties that hold almost everywhere form a filter,
but Mathlib introduces special notation for saying that a property holds
almost everywhere.
