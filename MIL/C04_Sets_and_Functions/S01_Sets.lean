Sets

.. index:: set operations

If ``α`` is any type, the type ``Set α`` consists of sets
of elements of ``α``.
This type supports the usual set-theoretic operations and relations.
For example, ``s ⊆ t`` says that ``s`` is a subset of ``t``,
``s ∩ t`` denotes the intersection of ``s`` and ``t``,
and ``s ∪ t`` denotes their union.
The subset relation can be typed with ``\ss`` or ``\sub``,
intersection can be typed with ``\i`` or ``\cap``,
and union can be typed with ``\un`` or ``\cup``.
The library also defines the set ``univ``,
which consists of all the elements of type ``α``,
and the empty set, ``∅``, which can be typed as ``\empty``.
Given ``x : α`` and ``s : Set α``,
the expression ``x ∈ s`` says that ``x`` is a member of ``s``.
Theorems that mention set membership often include ``mem``
in their name.
The expression ``x ∉ s`` abbreviates ``¬ x ∈ s``.
You can type ``∈`` as ``\in`` or ``\mem`` and ``∉`` as ``\notin``.

.. index:: simp, tactics ; simp

One way to prove things about sets is to use ``rw``
or the simplifier to expand the definitions.
In the second example below, we use ``simp only``
to tell the simplifier to use only the list
of identities we give it,
and not its full database of identities.
Unlike ``rw``, ``simp`` can perform simplifications
inside a universal or existential quantifier.
If you step through the proof,
you can see the effects of these commands.

To deal with unions, we can use ``Set.union_def`` and ``Set.mem_union``.
Since ``x ∈ s ∪ t`` unfolds to ``x ∈ s ∨ x ∈ t``,
we can also use the ``cases`` tactic to force a definitional reduction.

It might help to know that when using ``rintro``,
sometimes we need to use parentheses around a disjunctive pattern
``h1 | h2`` to get Lean to parse it correctly.

The library also defines set difference, ``s \ t``,
where the backslash is a special unicode character
entered as ``\\``.
The expression ``x ∈ s \ t`` expands to ``x ∈ s ∧ x ∉ t``.
(The ``∉`` can be entered as ``\notin``.)
It can be rewritten manually using ``Set.diff_eq`` and ``dsimp``
or ``Set.mem_diff``,
but the following two proofs of the same inclusion
show how to avoid using them.

/- TEXT:
When it comes to representing sets,
here is what is going on underneath the hood.
In type theory, a *property* or *predicate* on a type ``α``
is just a function ``P : α → Prop``.
This makes sense:
given ``a : α``, ``P a`` is just the proposition
that ``P`` holds of ``a``.
In the library, ``Set α`` is defined to be ``α → Prop`` and ``x ∈ s`` is defined to be ``s x``.
In other words, sets are really properties, treated as objects.

The library also defines set-builder notation.
The expression ``{ y | P y }`` unfolds to ``(fun y ↦ P y)``,
so ``x ∈ { y | P y }`` reduces to ``P x``.
So we can turn the property of being even into the set of even numbers:
TEXT. -/
-- QUOTE:
def evens : Set ℕ :=
  { n | Even n }

def odds : Set ℕ :=
  { n | ¬Even n }

example : evens ∪ odds = univ := by
  rw [evens, odds]
  ext n
  simp
  apply Classical.em
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
You should step through this proof and make sure
you understand what is going on.
Try deleting the line ``rw [evens, odds]``
and confirm that the proof still works.

In fact, set-builder notation is used to define

- ``s ∩ t`` as ``{x | x ∈ s ∧ x ∈ t}``,
- ``s ∪ t`` as ``{x | x ∈ s ∨ x ∈ t}``,
- ``∅`` as ``{x | False}``, and
- ``univ`` as ``{x | True}``.

We often need to indicate the type of ``∅`` and ``univ``
explicitly,
because Lean has trouble guessing which ones we mean.
The following examples show how Lean unfolds the last
two definitions when needed. In the second one,
``trivial`` is the canonical proof of ``True`` in the library.

As an exercise, prove the following inclusion.
Use ``intro n`` to unfold the definition of subset,

Be careful: it is somewhat confusing that the library has multiple versions
of the predicate ``Prime``.
The most general one makes sense in any commutative monoid with a zero element.
The predicate ``Nat.Prime`` is specific to the natural numbers.

the two notions agree, so you can always rewrite one to the other.

.. index:: bounded quantifiers

Lean introduces the notation ``∀ x ∈ s, ...``,
"for every ``x`` in ``s`` .,"
as an abbreviation for  ``∀ x, x ∈ s → ...``.
It also introduces the notation ``∃ x ∈ s, ...,``
"there exists an ``x`` in ``s`` such that .."
These are sometimes known as *bounded quantifiers*,
because the construction serves to restrict their significance
to the set ``s``.
As a result, theorems in the library that make use of them
often contain ``ball`` or ``bex`` in the name.
The theorem ``bex_def`` asserts that ``∃ x ∈ s, ...`` is equivalent
to ``∃ x, x ∈ s ∧ ...,``
but when they are used with ``rintro``, ``use``,
and anonymous constructors,
these two expressions behave roughly the same.
As a result, we usually don't need to use ``bex_def``
to transform them explicitly.
Here is are some examples of how they are used:
