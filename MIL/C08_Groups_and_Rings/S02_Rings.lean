Rings, their units, morphisms and subrings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The type of ring structures on a type ``R`` is ``Ring R``. The variant where multiplication is
assumed to be commutative is ``CommRing R``. We have already seen that the ``ring`` tactic will
prove any equality that follows from the axioms of a commutative ring.
EXAMPLES: -/
-- QUOTE:
example {R : Type*} [CommRing R] (x y : R) : (x + y) ^ 2 = x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 + 2 * x * y := by ring
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
More exotic variants do not require that the addition on ``R`` forms a group but only an additive
monoid. The corresponding type classes are ``Semiring R`` and ``CommSemiring R``.
The type of natural numbers is an important instance of ``CommSemiring R``, as is any type
of functions taking values in the natural numbers.
Another important example is the type of ideals in a ring, which will be discussed below.
The name of the ``ring`` tactic is doubly misleading, since it assumes commutativity but works
in semirings as well. In other words, it applies to any ``CommSemiring``.
EXAMPLES: -/
-- QUOTE:
example (x y : ℕ) : (x + y) ^ 2 = x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 + 2 * x * y := by ring
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
There are also versions of the ring and semiring classes that do not assume the existence of a
multiplicative unit or
the associativity of multiplication. We will not discuss those here.

Some concepts that are traditionally taught in an introduction to ring theory are actually about
the underlying multiplicative monoid.
A prominent example is the definition of the units of a ring. Every (multiplicative) monoid ``M``
has a predicate ``IsUnit : M → Prop`` asserting existence of a two-sided inverse, a
type ``Units M`` of units with notation ``Mˣ``, and a coercion to ``M``.
The type ``Units M`` bundles an invertible element with its inverse as well as properties than ensure
that each is indeed the inverse of the other.
This implementation detail is relevant mainly when defining computable functions. In most
situations one can use ``IsUnit.unit {x : M} : IsUnit x → Mˣ`` to build a unit.
In the commutative case, one also has ``Units.mkOfMulEqOne (x y : M) : x * y = 1 → Mˣ``
which builds ``x`` seen as unit.
EXAMPLES: -/
-- QUOTE:
example (x : ℤˣ) : x = 1 ∨ x = -1 := Int.units_eq_one_or x

example {M : Type*} [Monoid M] (x : Mˣ) : (x : M) * x⁻¹ = 1 := Units.mul_inv x

example {M : Type*} [Monoid M] : Group Mˣ := inferInstance
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
The type of ring morphisms between two (semi)-rings ``R`` and ``S`` is ``RingHom R S``,
with notation ``R →+* S``.
EXAMPLES: -/
-- QUOTE:
example {R S : Type*} [Ring R] [Ring S] (f : R →+* S) (x y : R) :
    f (x + y) = f x + f y := f.map_add x y

example {R S : Type*} [Ring R] [Ring S] (f : R →+* S) : Rˣ →* Sˣ :=
  Units.map f
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
The isomorphism variant is ``RingEquiv``, with notation ``≃+*``.

As with submonoids and subgroups, there is a ``Subring R`` type for subrings of a ring ``R``,
but this type is a lot less useful than the type of subgroups since one cannot quotient a ring by
a subring.
EXAMPLES: -/
-- QUOTE:
example {R : Type*} [Ring R] (S : Subring R) : Ring S := inferInstance
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
Also notice that ``RingHom.range`` produces a subring.

Ideals and quotients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For historical reasons, Mathlib only has a theory of ideals for commutative rings.
(The ring library was originally developed to make quick progress toward the foundations of modern
algebraic geometry.) So in this section we will work with commutative (semi)rings.
Ideals of ``R`` are defined as submodules of ``R`` seen as ``R``-modules. Modules will
be covered later in a chapter on linear algebra, but this implementation detail can mostly be
safely ignored since most (but not all) relevant lemmas are restated in the special context of
ideals. But anonymous projection notation won't always work as expected. For instance,
one cannot replace ``Ideal.Quotient.mk I`` by ``I.Quotient.mk`` in the snippet below because there
are two ``.``s and so it will parse as ``(Ideal.Quotient I).mk``; but ``Ideal.Quotient`` by itself
doesn't exist.
EXAMPLES: -/
-- QUOTE:
example {R : Type*} [CommRing R] (I : Ideal R) : R →+* R ⧸ I :=
  Ideal.Quotient.mk I

example {R : Type*} [CommRing R] {a : R} {I : Ideal R} :
    Ideal.Quotient.mk I a = 0 ↔ a ∈ I :=
  Ideal.Quotient.eq_zero_iff_mem

The universal property of quotient rings is ``Ideal.Quotient.lift``.

-- QUOTE.

end

/- TEXT:
One can use ring morphisms to push ideals forward and pull them back using ``Ideal.map`` and
``Ideal.comap``, respectively. As usual,
the latter is more convenient to use since it does not involve an existential quantifier.
This explains why it is used to state the condition that allows us to build morphisms between
quotient rings.

  Ideal.quotientMap J f H
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
One subtle point is that the type ``R ⧸ I`` really depends on ``I``
(up to definitional equality), so having a proof that two ideals ``I`` and ``J`` are equal is not
enough to make the corresponding quotients equal. However, the universal properties do provide
an isomorphism in this case.

We can now present the Chinese remainder isomorphism as an example. Pay attention to the difference

Algebras and polynomials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Given a commutative (semi)ring ``R``, an *algebra over* ``R`` is a semiring ``A`` equipped
with a ring morphism whose image commutes with every element of ``A``. This is encoded as
a type class ``Algebra R A``.
The morphism from ``R`` to ``A`` is called the structure map and is denoted
``algebraMap R A : R →+* A`` in Lean.
Multiplication of ``a : A`` by ``algebraMap R A r`` for some ``r : R`` is called the scalar
multiplication of ``a`` by ``r`` and denoted by ``r • a``.
Note that this notion of algebra is sometimes called an *associative unital algebra* to emphasize the
existence of more general notions of algebra.

The fact that ``algebraMap R A`` is ring morphism packages together a lot of properties of scalar
multiplication, such as the following:
EXAMPLES: -/
-- QUOTE:
example {R A : Type*} [CommRing R] [Ring A] [Algebra R A] (r r' : R) (a : A) :
    (r + r') • a = r • a + r' • a :=
  add_smul r r' a

example {R A : Type*} [CommRing R] [Ring A] [Algebra R A] (r r' : R) (a : A) :
    (r * r') • a = r • r' • a :=
  mul_smul r r' a
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
The morphisms between two ``R``-algebras ``A`` and ``B`` are ring morphisms
which commute with scalar multiplication by elements of ``R``. They are bundled morphisms
with type ``AlgHom R A B``, which is denoted by ``A →ₐ[R] B``.

Important examples of non-commutative algebras include algebras of endomorphisms and
algebras of square matrices, both of which will be covered in the chapter on linear algebra.
In this chapter we will discuss one of the most important examples of a commutative algebra,
namely, polynomial algebras.

The algebra of univariate polynomials with coefficients in ``R`` is called ``Polynomial R``,
which can be written as ``R[X]`` as soon as one opens the ``Polynomial`` namespace.
The algebra structure map from ``R`` to ``R[X]`` is denoted by ``C``,
which stands for "constant" since the corresponding
polynomial functions are always constant. The indeterminate is denoted by ``X``.

/- TEXT:
In the first example above, it is crucial that we give Lean the expected type since it cannot be
determined from the body of the definition. In the second example, the target polynomial
algebra can be inferred from our use of ``C r`` since the type of ``r`` is known.

Because ``C`` is a ring morphism from ``R`` to ``R[X]``, we can use all ring morphisms lemmas
such as ``map_zero``, ``map_one``, ``map_mul``, and ``map_pow`` before computing in the ring
``R[X]``. For example:
EXAMPLES: -/

-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
Defining the degree of a polynomial is always tricky because of the special case of the zero
polynomial. Mathlib has two variants: ``Polynomial.natDegree : R[X] → ℕ`` assigns degree
``0`` to the zero polynomial, and ``Polynomial.degree : R[X] → WithBot ℕ`` assigns ``⊥``.
In the latter, ``WithBot ℕ`` can be seen as ``ℕ ∪ {-∞}``, except that ``-∞`` is denoted ``⊥``,
the same symbol as the bottom element in a complete lattice. This special value is used as the
degree of the zero polynomial, and it is absorbent for addition. (It is almost absorbent for
multiplication, except that ``⊥ * 0 = 0``.)

Morally speaking, the ``degree`` version is the correct one. For instance, it allows us to state
the expected formula for the degree of a product (assuming the base ring has no zero divisor).
EXAMPLES: -/
-- QUOTE:
example {R : Type*} [Semiring R] [NoZeroDivisors R] {p q : R[X]} :
    degree (p * q) = degree p + degree q :=
  Polynomial.degree_mul
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
Whereas the version for ``natDegree`` needs to assume non-zero polynomials.
EXAMPLES: -/
-- QUOTE:
example {R : Type*} [Semiring R] [NoZeroDivisors R] {p q : R[X]} (hp : p ≠ 0) (hq : q ≠ 0) :
    natDegree (p * q) = natDegree p + natDegree q :=
  Polynomial.natDegree_mul hp hq
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
However, ``ℕ`` is much nicer to use than ``WithBot ℕ``, so Mathlib makes both versions available
and provides lemmas to convert between them. Also, ``natDegree`` is the more convenient definition
to use when computing the degree of a composition. Composition of polynomial is ``Polynomial.comp``
and we have:
EXAMPLES: -/
-- QUOTE:
example {R : Type*} [Semiring R] [NoZeroDivisors R] {p q : R[X]} :
    natDegree (comp p q) = natDegree p * natDegree q :=

Polynomials give rise to polynomial functions: any polynomial can be evaluated on ``R``
using ``Polynomial.eval``.

example {R : Type*} [CommRing R] (r : R) : (X - C r).eval r = 0 := by simp

/- TEXT:
In particular, there is a predicate, ``IsRoot``, that holds for elements ``r`` in ``R`` where a
polynomial vanishes.

/- TEXT:
We would like to say that, assuming ``R`` has no zero divisor, a polynomial has at most as many
roots as its degree, where the roots are counted with multiplicities.
But once again the case of the zero polynomial is painful.
So Mathlib defines ``Polynomial.roots`` to send a polynomial ``P`` to a multiset,
i.e. the finite set that is defined to be empty if ``P`` is zero and the roots of ``P``,
with multiplicities, otherwise. This is defined only when the underlying ring is a domain
since otherwise the definition does not have good properties.

/- TEXT:
Both ``Polynomial.eval`` and ``Polynomial.roots`` consider only the coefficients ring. They do not
allow us to say that ``X ^ 2 - 2 : ℚ[X]`` has a root in ``ℝ`` or that ``X ^ 2 + 1 : ℝ[X]`` has a root in
``ℂ``. For this, we need ``Polynomial.aeval``, which will evaluate ``P : R[X]`` in any ``R``-algebra.
More precisely, given a semiring ``A`` and an instance of ``Algebra R A``, ``Polynomial.aeval`` sends
every element of ``a`` along the ``R``-algebra morphism of evaluation at ``a``. Since ``AlgHom``
has a coercion to functions, one can apply it to a polynomial.
But ``aeval`` does not have a polynomial as an argument, so one cannot use dot notation like in
``P.eval`` above.

Let us end by mentioning multivariate polynomials briefly. Given a commutative semiring ``R``,
the ``R``-algebra of polynomials with coefficients in ``R`` and indeterminates indexed by
a type ``σ`` is ``MVPolynomial σ R``. Given ``i : σ``, the corresponding polynomial is
``MvPolynomial.X i``. (As usual, one can open the ``MVPolynomial`` namespace to shorten this
to ``X i``.)
For instance, if we want two indeterminates we can use
``Fin 2`` as ``σ`` and write the polynomial defining the unit circle in :math:`\mathbb{R}^2`` as:
