Discrete Mathematics
====================

*Discrete Mathematics* is the study of finite sets, objects, and structures.
We can count the elements of a finite set or we can consider a finite sum or product over its
elements.
We can iterate an operation over the elements of a finite structure.
We can also study objects that are generated by finitely many applications of
certain generating functions, we can define functions by structural recursion,
and prove theorems by structural induction.
The aim of this chapter is to survey parts of Mathlib that support all these types
of reasoning.
