Discrete Mathematics
====================

*Discrete Mathematics* is the study of finite sets, objects, and structures.
Finite sets support a variety of important operations:
we can count the elements of a finite set, and we can compute finite sums or products over its
elements and compute maximums and minimums.
We can also study objects that are generated by finitely many applications of
certain generating functions, we can define functions by structural recursion,
and prove theorems by structural induction.
This chapters describes parts of Mathlib that support these.
