Basics
------

At the very bottom of all hierarchies in Lean, we find data-carrying
classes. The following class records that the given type ``α`` is endowed with
a distinguished element called ``one``. At this stage, it has no property at all.
BOTH: -/

-- QUOTE:
class One₁ (α : Type) where
  /-- The element one -/
  one : α
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
Since we'll make a much heavier use of classes in this chapter, we need to understand some
more details about what the ``class`` command is doing.
First, the ``class`` command above defines a structure ``One₁`` with parameter ``α : Type`` and
a single field ``one``. It also mark this structure as a class so that arguments of type
``One₁ α`` for some type ``α`` will be inferrable using the instance resolution procedure,
as long as they are marked as instance-implicit, ie appear between square brackets.
Those two effects could also have been achieved using the ``structure`` command with ``class``
attribute, ie writing ``@[class] structure`` instance of ``class``. But the class command also
ensures that ``One₁ α`` appears as an instance-implicit argument in its own fields. Compare:
BOTH: -/

-- QUOTE:
#check One₁.one -- One₁.one {α : Type} [self : One₁ α] : α

@[class] structure One₂ (α : Type) where
  /-- The element one -/
  one : α

#check One₂.one
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
In the second check, we can see that ``self : One₂ α`` is an explicit argument.
Let us make sure the first version is indeed usable without any explicit argument.
BOTH: -/

-- QUOTE:
example (α : Type) [One₁ α] : α := One₁.one
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
Remark: in the above example, the argument ``One₁ α`` is marked as instance-implicit,
which is a bit silly since this affects only *uses* of the declaration and declaration created by
the ``example`` command cannot be used. However it allows to avoid giving a name to that
argument and, more importantly, it starts installing the good habit of marking ``One₁ α``
arguments as instance-implicit.

Another remark is that all this will work only when Lean knows what is ``α``. In the above
example, leaving out the type ascription ``: α`` would generate an error message like:
``typeclass instance problem is stuck, it is often due to metavariables One₁ (?m.263 α)``
where ``?m.263 α`` means "some type depending on ``α``" (and 263 is simply an auto-generated
index that would be useful to distinguish between several unknown things). Another way
to avoid this issue would be to use a type annotation, as in:
BOTH: -/
-- QUOTE:
example (α : Type) [One₁ α] := (One₁.one : α)
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
You may have already encountered that issue when playing with limits of sequences
in :numref:`sequences_and_convergence` if you tried to state for instance that
``0 < 1`` without telling Lean whether you meant this inequality to be about natural numbers
or real numbers.

Our next task is to assign a notation to ``One₁.one``. Since we don't want collisions
with the builtin notation for ``1``, we will use ``𝟙``. This is achieved by the following
command where the first line tells Lean to use the documentation
of ``One₁.one`` as documentation for the symbol ``𝟙``.
BOTH: -/
-- QUOTE:
@[inherit_doc]
notation "𝟙" => One₁.one

example {α : Type} [One₁ α] : α := 𝟙

example {α : Type} [One₁ α] : (𝟙 : α) = 𝟙 := rfl
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
We now want a data-carrying class recording a binary operation. We don't want to choose
between addition and multiplication for now so we'll use diamond.
BOTH: -/

-- QUOTE:
class Dia₁ (α : Type) where
  dia : α → α → α

infixl:70 " ⋄ "   => Dia₁.dia
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
As in the ``One₁`` example, the operation has no property at all at this stage. Let us
now define the class of semigroup structures where the operation is denoted by ``⋄``.
For now, we define it by hand as a structure with two fields, a ``Dia₁`` instance and some
``Prop``-valued field ``dia_assoc`` asserting associativity of ``⋄``.
BOTH: -/

-- QUOTE:
class Semigroup₁ (α : Type) where
  toDia₁ : Dia₁ α
  /-- Diamond is associative -/
  dia_assoc : ∀ a b c : α, a ⋄ b ⋄ c = a ⋄ (b ⋄ c)
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
Note that while stating `dia_assoc`, the previously defined field `toDia₁` is in the local
context hence can be used when Lean searches for an instance of `Dia₁ α` to make sense
of `a ⋄ b`. However this `toDia₁` field does not become part of the type class instances database.
Hence doing ``example {α : Type} [Semigroup₁ α] (a b : α) : α := a ⋄ b`` would fail with
error message ``failed to synthesize instance Dia₁ α``.

We can fix this by adding the ``instance`` attribute later.
BOTH: -/

-- QUOTE:
attribute [instance] Semigroup₁.toDia₁

example {α : Type} [Semigroup₁ α] (a b : α) : α := a ⋄ b
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
Before building up, we need a more convenient way to extend structures than explicitly
writing fields like `toDia₁` and adding the instance attribute by hand. The ``class``
supports this using the ``extends`` syntax as in:
BOTH: -/

-- QUOTE:
class Semigroup₂ (α : Type) extends Dia₁ α where
  /-- Diamond is associative -/
  dia_assoc : ∀ a b c : α, a ⋄ b ⋄ c = a ⋄ (b ⋄ c)

example {α : Type} [Semigroup₂ α] (a b : α) : α := a ⋄ b
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
Note this syntax is also available in the ``structure`` command, although it that
case it fixes only the hurdle of writing fields such as `toDia₁` since there
is no instance to define in that case.


Let us now try to combine a diamond operation and a distinguished one with axioms saying
this element is neutral on both sides.
BOTH: -/
-- QUOTE:
class DiaOneClass₁ (α : Type) extends One₁ α, Dia₁ α where
  /-- One is a left neutral element for diamond. -/
  one_dia : ∀ a : α, 𝟙 ⋄ a = a
  /-- One is a right neutral element for diamond -/
  dia_one : ∀ a : α, a ⋄ 𝟙 = a

-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
In the next example, we tell Lean that ``α`` has a ``DiaOneClass₁`` structure and state a
property that uses both a `Dia₁` instance and a `One₁` instance. In order to see how Lean finds
those instances we set a tracing option whose result can be seen in the info view. This result
is rather terse by default but can be expended by clicking one lines ending with black arrows.
It includes failed attempts where Lean tried to find instances before having enough type
information to succeed. The successful attempts do involve the instances generated by the
``extends`` syntax.
BOTH: -/

-- QUOTE:
set_option trace.Meta.synthInstance true in
example {α : Type} [DiaOneClass₁ α] (a b : α) : Prop := a ⋄ b = 𝟙
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
Note that we don't need to include extra fields where combining existing classes. Hence we can
define monoids as:
BOTH: -/

-- QUOTE:
class Monoid₁ (α : Type) extends Semigroup₁ α, DiaOneClass₁ α
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
While the above definition seems straightforward, it hides an important subtlety. Both
``Semigroup₁ α`` and ``DiaOneClass₁ α`` extend ``Dia₁ α``, so one could fear that having
a ``Monoid₁ α`` instance gives two unrelated diamond operations on ``α``, one coming from
a field ``Monoid₁.toSemigroup₁`` and one coming from a field ``Monoid₁.toDiaOneClass₁``.

Indeed if we try to build a monoid class by hand using:
BOTH: -/

-- QUOTE:
class Monoid₂ (α : Type) where
  toSemigroup₁ : Semigroup₁ α
  toDiaOneClass₁ : DiaOneClass₁ α
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
then we get two completely unrelated diamond operations
``Monoid₂.toSemigroup₁.toDia₁.dia`` and ``Monoid₂.toDiaOneClass₁.toDia₁.dia``.

The version generated using the ``extends`` syntax does not have this defect.
BOTH: -/

-- QUOTE:
example {α : Type} [Monoid₁ α] :
  (Monoid₁.toSemigroup₁.toDia₁.dia : α → α → α) = Monoid₁.toDiaOneClass₁.toDia₁.dia := rfl
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
So the ``class`` command did some magic for us (and the ``structure`` command would have done it
too). An easy way to see what are the fields of our classes is to check their constructor. Compare:
BOTH: -/

-- QUOTE:
/- Monoid₂.mk {α : Type} (toSemigroup₁ : Semigroup₁ α) (toDiaOneClass₁ : DiaOneClass₁ α) : Monoid₂ α -/
#check Monoid₂.mk

/- Monoid₁.mk {α : Type} [toSemigroup₁ : Semigroup₁ α] [toOne₁ : One₁ α] (one_dia : ∀ (a : α), 𝟙 ⋄ a = a) (dia_one : ∀ (a : α), a ⋄ 𝟙 = a) : Monoid₁ α -/
#check Monoid₁.mk
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
So we see that ``Monoid₁`` takes ``Semigroup₁ α`` argument as expected but then it won't
take a would-be overlapping ``DiaOneClass₁ α`` argument but instead tears it apart and includes
only the non-overlapping parts. And it also auto-generated an instance ``Monoid₁.toDiaOneClass₁``
which is *not* a field but has the expected signature which, from the end-user point of view,
restores the symmetry between the two extended classes ``Semigroup₁`` and ``DiaOneClass₁``.
BOTH: -/

-- QUOTE:
#check Monoid₁.toSemigroup₁
#check Monoid₁.toDiaOneClass₁
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
We are now very close to defining groups. We could add to the monoid structure a field asserting
the existence of an inverse for every element. But then we would need to work to access these
inverses. In practice it is more convenient to add it as data. To optimize reusability,
we define a new data-carrying class, and then give it some notation.
BOTH: -/

-- QUOTE:
class Inv₁ (α : Type) where
  /-- The inversion function -/
  inv : α → α

@[inherit_doc]
postfix:max "⁻¹" => Inv₁.inv

class Group₁ (G : Type) extends Monoid₁ G, Inv G where
  inv_dia : ∀ a : G, a⁻¹ ⋄ a = 𝟙
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
The above definition may seem too weak, we only ask that ``a⁻¹`` is a left-inverse of ``a``.
But the other side is automatic. In order to prove that, we need a preliminary lemma.
BOTH: -/

-- QUOTE:
lemma left_inv_eq_right_inv₁ {M : Type} [Monoid₁ M] {a b c : M} (hba : b ⋄ a = 𝟙) (hac : a ⋄ c = 𝟙) : b = c := by
  rw [← DiaOneClass₁.one_dia c, ← hba, Semigroup₁.dia_assoc, hac, DiaOneClass₁.dia_one b]
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
In this lemma, it is pretty annoying to give full names, especially since it requires knowing
which part of the hierarchy provides those facts. One way to fix this is to use the ``export``
command to copy those facts as lemmas in the root name space.
BOTH: -/

-- QUOTE:
export DiaOneClass₁ (one_dia dia_one)
export Semigroup₁ (dia_assoc)
export Group₁ (inv_dia)
-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
We can then rewrite the above proof as:
BOTH: -/

-- QUOTE.

/- TEXT:
At this stage we would like to move on to define rings, but there is a serious issue.
A ring structure on a type contains both an additive group structure and a multiplicative
monoid structure, and some properties about their interaction. But so far we hard-coded
a notation ``⋄`` for all our operations. More fundamentally, the type class system
assumes every type has only one instance of each type class. There are various
ways to solve this issue. Surprisingly mathlib uses the naive idea to duplicate
everything for additive and multiplicative theories with the help of some code-generating
attribute. Structures and classes are defined in both additive and multiplicative notation
with an attribute ``to_additive`` linking them. In case of multiple inheritance like for
semi-groups, the auto-generated "symmetry-restoring" instances need also to be marked.
This is a bit technical you don't need to understand details. The important point is that
lemmas are then only stated in multiplicative notation and marked with the attribute ``to_additive``
to generate the additive version as ``left_inv_eq_right_inv'`` with it's auto-generated additive
version ``left_neg_eq_right_neg'``. In order to check the name of this additive version we
used the ``whatsnew in`` command on top of ``left_inv_eq_right_inv'``.

We now want to discuss algebraic structures involving several types. The prime example
is modules over rings. If you don't know what is a module, you can pretend it means vector space
and think that all our rings are fields. Those structures are commutative additive groups
equipped with a scalar multiplication by elements of some ring.

We first define the data-carrying type class of scalar multiplication by some type ``α`` on some
type ``β``, and give it a right associative notation.

There is something interesting going on here. While it isn't too surprising that the
ring structure on ``R`` is a parameter in this definition, you probably expected ``AddCommGroup₃ M``
to be part of the ``extends`` clause just as ``SMul₃ R M`` is.  Trying to do that would lead
to a mysterious sounding error message:
``cannot find synthesization order for instance Module₁.toAddCommGroup₃ with type (R : Type) → [inst : Ring₃ R] → {M : Type} → [self : Module₁ R M] → AddCommGroup₃ M
all remaining arguments have metavariables: Ring₃ ?R @Module₁ ?R ?inst✝ M``.
In order to understand this message, you need to remember that such an ``extends`` clause would
lead to a field ``Module₃.toAddCommGroup₃`` marked as an instance. This instance
would have the signature appearing in the error message:
``(R : Type) → [inst : Ring₃ R] → {M : Type} → [self : Module₁ R M] → AddCommGroup₃ M``.
With such an instance in the type class database, each time Lean would look for a
``AddCommGroup₃ M`` instance for some ``M``, it would need to go hunting for a completely
unspecified type ``R`` and a ``Ring₃ R`` instance before embarking on the main quest of finding a
``Module₁ R M`` instance. Those two side-quests are represented by the meta-variables mentioned in
the error message and denoted by ``?R`` and ``?inst✝`` there. Such a ``Module₃.toAddCommGroup₃``
instance would then be a huge trap for the instance resolution procedure and then ``class`` command
refuses to set it up.

What about ``extends SMul₃ R M`` then? That one creates a field
``Module₁.toSMul₃ : {R : Type} →  [inst : Ring₃ R] → {M : Type} → [inst_1 : AddCommGroup₃ M] → [self : Module₁ R M] → SMul₃ R M``
whose end result ``SMul₃ R M`` mentions both ``R`` and ``M`` so this field can
safely be used as an instance. The rule is easy to remember: each class appearing in the
``extends`` clause should mention every type appearing in the parameters.

Let us create our first module instance: a ring is a module over itself using its multiplication
as a scalar multiplication.

/- TEXT:
As a second example, every abelian group is a module over ``ℤ`` (this is one of the reason to
generalize the theory of vector spaces by allowing non-invertible scalars). First one can define
scalar multiplication by a natural number for any type equipped with a zero and an addition:
``n • a`` is defined as ``a + ⋯ + a`` where ``a`` appears ``n`` times. Then this is extended
to scalar multiplication by an integer by ensuring ``(-1) • a = -a``.

A much more important issue is that we now have two module structures over the ring ``ℤ``
for ``ℤ`` itself: ``abGrpModule ℤ`` since ``ℤ`` is a abelian group, and ``selfModule ℤ`` since
``ℤ`` is a ring. Those two module structure correspond to the same abelian group structure,
but it is not obvious that they have the same scalar multiplication. They actually do, but
this isn't true by definition, it requires a proof. This is very bad news for the type class
instance resolution procedure and will lead to very frustrating failures for users of this

which one using:

But in a more indirect context it can happen that Lean infers the one and then gets confused.
This situation is known as a bad diamond. This has nothing to do with the diamond operation
we used above, it refers to the way one can draw the paths from ``ℤ`` to its ``Module₁ ℤ``
going through either ``AddCommGroup₃ ℤ`` or ``Ring₃ ℤ``.

It is important to understand that not all diamonds are bad. In fact there are diamonds everywhere
in mathlib, and also in this chapter. Already at the very beginning we saw one can go
from ``Monoid₁ α`` to ``Dia₁ α`` through either ``Semigroup₁ α`` or ``DiaOneClass₁ α`` and
thanks to the work done by the ``class`` command, the resulting two ``Dia₁ α`` instances
are definitionally equal. In particular a diamond having a ``Prop``-valued class at the bottom
cannot be bad since any too proofs of the same statement are definitionally equal.

But the diamond we created with modules is definitely bad. The offending piece is the ``smul``
field which is data, not a proof, and we have two constructions that are not definitionally equal.
The robust way of fixing this issue is to make sure that going from a rich structure to a
poor structure is always done by forgetting data, not by defining data. This well-known pattern
as been named "forgetful inheritance" and extensively discussed in
https://inria.hal.science/hal-02463336.

In our concrete case, we can modify the definition of ``AddMonoid₃`` to include a ``nsmul`` data
field and some ``Prop``-valued fields ensuring this operation is provably the one we constructed
above. Those fields are given default values using ``:=`` after their type in the definition below.
Thanks to these default values, most instances would be constructed exactly as with our previous
definitions. But in the special case of ``ℤ`` we will be able to provide specific values.

And now let us handle the special case of ``ℤ`` where we want to build ``nsmul`` using the coercion
of ``ℕ`` to ``ℤ`` and the multiplication on ``ℤ``. Note in particular how the proof fields
contain more work than in the default value above.

Let us check we solved our issue. Because Lean already has a definition of scalar multiplication
of a natural number and an integer, and we want to make sure our instance is used, we won't use
the ``•`` notation but call ``SMul.mul`` and explicitly provide our instance defined above.

This story then continues with incorporating a ``zsmul`` field into the definition of groups
and similar tricks. You are now ready to read the definition of monoids, groups, rings and modules
in mathlib. There are more complicated than what we have seen here, because they are part of a huge
hierarchy, but all principles have been explained above.

As an exercise, you can come back to the order relation hierarchy you built above and try
to incorporate a type class ``LT₁`` carrying the Less-Than notation ``<₁`` and make sure
that every preorder comes with a ``<₁`` which has a default value built from ``≤₁`` and a
``Prop``-valued field asserting the natural relation between those two comparison operators.
