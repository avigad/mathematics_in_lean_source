# Mathematics in Lean

This tutorial depends on Lean, VS Code, and mathlib.
You can install them following the instructions
in the mathlib repository,
<https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib>.

To use this tutorial, you need to set up a project folder.
Open a terminal and type:
```
leanproject get mathematics_in_lean
```
Then open the project in VS Code:
```
code mathematics_in_lean
```
Once VS Code starts, open the file `welcome.lean`.
That will load the tutorial in a
separate window, and you are good to go.
